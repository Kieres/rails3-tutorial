#### {% title "Autoryzacja" %}

<blockquote>
 <p>Once the system knows who the user is through 
  authentication, authorization is how the system decides 
  what the user can do.</p>
 <p>A good example of this is using group permissions or the 
  difference between a normal user and the superuser on a 
  unix system.</p>
